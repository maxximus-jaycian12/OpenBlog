# How to run in IDE

### Adding Project Lombok Agent


This project uses http://projectlombok.org/features/index.html[Project Lombok] to generate getters and setters etc.

 Full instructions can be found in the Lombok website. The sign that you need to do this is a lot of compiler errors
 to do with missing methods and fields.
